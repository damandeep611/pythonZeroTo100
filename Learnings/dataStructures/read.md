The data structures in python allow us to store the values in different forms and different ways to manipulate data stored in those structures 


1. Dictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs.
2. Lists: Ordered collections of elements, where elements can be of any data type.
3. Tuples: Immutable ordered collections of elements.
4. Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements.

# a short task that you may want to perform in multiple parts of the program , so we use functions to wrap that short task, and use that function whenever we want to execute that short ask again in the program
#  we use functions when we want to reuse that block of code again, and also to break down the large problem that we are solving by breaking down into smaller functions , that solve multiple small areas of the function, 

#basi syntax 
def function_name(parameters): #parameters is  - a variable of list of variable that is passed to the fn

  #fn body or the task code
  pass

# example 
def say_hello(name):
  print(f"hey {name}, nice to meet you")

say_hello("baba Yaga") # this is how we call a function

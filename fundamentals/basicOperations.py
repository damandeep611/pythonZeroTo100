# basic arithmatic operations 
a = 10
b = 5
x = 300

# print(a + b); 
# print(a -b);
# print(a * b );
# print(a / b);
# print(a % b);
# print(a ** b);
# print(a // b);



# augmented assignment operator
a += x
print(a)
a *= b + x
print(a)
# so we can see that the augmented assignment operator is a shorthand for the basic arithmatic operations,

# string operations 
first_name = "John"
last_name = "wick"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)

# in python semicolons are optional, as python use indentation (whitespace) to define code blocks and code structure, so therefore the semicolon is redundant as pyton uses whitespace to structure the code

# so if we have to write multiple lines we can use semicolons to divide the code , for better visibility and reading 
my_name = "xavier" ; ser_name = "charles"
print(f"my name is {my_name}, and my ser name is {ser_name}, now get the f out of here ")

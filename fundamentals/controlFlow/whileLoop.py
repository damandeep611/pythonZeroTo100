#  here are some problems for you to practice:

# Guess the number:
# Create a while loop that generates a random number between 1 and 100, then asks the user to guess it. The loop should continue until the user guesses correctly.
# Factorial calculator:
# Write a while loop to calculate the factorial of a given number. (Factorial of n is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n)
# Fibonacci sequence:
# Use a while loop to generate the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence. (Each number is the sum of the two preceding ones)
# Digit sum:
# Create a while loop that takes a positive integer as input and calculates the sum of its digits.
# Remove vowels:
# Write a while loop that removes all vowels from a given string.
